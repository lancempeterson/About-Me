**Language Learning**

I have put in place a framework and scheduled plan for reaching fluency in the Japanese Language.
This framework involves repping Kanji and Vocabulary sentence flash cards in the Anki spaced repetition system. Additionally the framework involves active immersion in the language including daily reading and listening practice. I have carried out this plan since May 07, 2020 with 100% accuracy.
